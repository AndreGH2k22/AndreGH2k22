    <h3>Dodge Challenger Recent Success</h3>

    <h4><em>Should The Buying Frenzy Begin NOW Or...?!?</em></h4>

    <div>
        <p>The Dodge Challenger is the most popular muscle car in America according
            to the final yearly tally at the end of 2021. Which is fitting because they
            are everywhere!!Along with the platform sharing Chrysler 300 and Dodge Charger these
            cars have been around for a while but they are loved especially in the models with the big
            Hemi V8's. Fast forward to 2022 with the Global chip shortage used Dodge Challenger
            Scatpack, Hellcat, and Redeye/Superstock models have had their prices inflate to more
            than they were when new!! 2 year old Challenger Scatpack widebody's have been seen
            regularly at over 60k MSRP!!!

    <div>Inflation Blues... to Golden Time To Get A Deal?!</div>
    <div>
        <p>But with war overseas and a hyper inflated economy causing gas prices to on average
            surpass $4.00 per gallon its likely that this shift may push the market to take a drastic
            dip. We will have to see if it makes the price gouging end as it becomes more of a competitive
            market potentially bringing prices to a level thats in favor of the customer?
            If it does we will let you know here first!!</p>

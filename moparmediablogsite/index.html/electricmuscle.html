    <h2>Is This The End?!</h2>

    <p>It's 2007...a full 38 years since the original Dodge Challenger came out in 1969
        as a 1970 model. Dodge had since made some pretty terrible cars in comparison to the future factory
        classics that were rolling off of assembly lines in the 70's, but that was all about to change.
        A resurrection of sorts... enter the 2008 Dodge Challenger SRT-8...a true "Muscle Car" in every sense
        of the name!! It even had a 6.1L Hemi V8 with 425HP just like the original 426 Hemi Challenger when it debuted.
        People including myself were excited to see it with so much presence and retro futuristic flare...
        Dodge had a hit on their hands!!!
    </p>

    <p>Since then we've been spoiled with a new age litany of macho powerhouses filled with more power than most
        thought was even possible...let alone street legal!! With vehicles such as the Scat Pack, Hellcat, Redeye, TRX,
        TRACKHAWK, SuperStock, Demon & more. But just when you thought that things were safe for us supercharged muscle
        car loving gear heads...fast forward to today a new presidency has caused a shift and acceleration in the switch
        to electrification with stricter emissions standards. Thus putting manufacturers in a tight spot and putting our
        dinosaur juice guzzling life-sized hotwheels at risk to a similar fate of those aforementioned over-grown
        chicken lizards.
    </p>

    <p>Enter E-MUSCLE!!!!! Dodge is prepared to release multiple hybrid and BEV vehicles over the next few years.
        Starting with the 2023 Dodge Hornet and a mysterious retro futuristic all new yet to be named mus.. excuse me
        E-MUSCLE
        CAR!!
        Dodge promises to release a fully working model of this so called E-MUSCLE car that has been shrouded in secrecy
        sometime in the coming months. There's been some pretty intriguing things said about this new vehicle such as
        promises for it to be a muscle car in the first place as Electric & Muscle being combined is uncharted
        territory.
        So far the response has been a mixed bag with some completely against the idea... and others more welcoming to
        the change its to be expected with such a radical change but as a fan of the brand I trust that if anyone could
        make something that will be redefining for a generation I trust Dodge until proven wrong. I plan to get a
        Hellcat crate or 2 for some interesting projects as well as a widebody challenger as i've sacrificed many
        birthdays and
        I deserve it LOL!!! So worst case I have my gas powered monsters and steer clear of the electric one's if it
        lets
        us down... or I need a bigger garage!!! #WinWin!!!!
